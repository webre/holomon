# Holomon
This is a pokemon-style game framework I created as my final project CMU's CS 15-112 class in Summer 2015.

Please note: This program is written in Python 2.7 and will __not__ work with Python 3.x.

## Instructions
Move with __A__ __S__ __D__ __F__. Use __E__ to interact with people or objects.

Open the menu with __ESC__. Confirm text boxes with __ENTER__.

Use the mouse to click menu items and battle options.

Walk across directional arrows to enter different maps. Walking in tall grass may lead to encounters with wild Holomon, and walking into a trainer's line of sight will trigger a battle.

## Config files
This is a *framework* for a pokemon-style game, so it is fully extensible in whichever way you see fit. The included files are simply a sample that demonstrates some core features of the game. The \*.dat files and image files that are placed in the designated folders define the game's entire functionality outside of its basic structure.
